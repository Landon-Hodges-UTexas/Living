Generative AI is not intelligent in the human sense. It doesn't think: it manipulates. It finds, distills, and reassembles patterns in the languages it has been trained on: English, Python, math, formal logic. Humans developed languages to express internal thought, but shaped them so robustly that they can approximate thought in many domains. AI doesn't experience the thoughts behind these languages: it replicates their cognitive patterns, efficiently, iteratively, and without fatigue.

But languages arise from lived experience. We create them to capture what matters to us: quantities, feelings, relationships, motion, logic. Every notation system reflects a particular way of seeing. AI inherits these worldviews. Not our consciousness, but our structures of attention. It depends on us for the frameworks that shape what can be modeled or reasoned about in the first place. 

So if we want AI to extend the reach of our thinking, not merely to mimic it, we need to create new languages that reflect dimensions of reality our current tools ignore. What if we created better syntaxes for grief, caregiving, crochet, or physical exercise? What would it look like for an AI to become fluent in these languages?

If we can push our minds beyond the language we're comfortable with, to discover new abstractions, we have the tools to extrapolate those new abstractions in every direction at lightning speed. The slightest breakthroughs in formalizing areas of thought that have escaped formalization–either for their inherent slipperiness or their cultural dismissal as "soft skills"–can now be magnified and readily applied to radically disparate fields. We can leverage the strength of the humanities in creating new dimensions of thought to ignite undiscovered oilfields of human experience from a single spark of inspiration.

If you hold a kind of knowledge that doesn’t show up in textbooks–whether as a dancer, a dungeon master, a caregiver, a movie lover, a street medic, or a tattoo artist–you have something vital to contribute. The world’s most enduring symbolic systems began informally: cartography from travelers’ sketches, music notation from oral traditions, mathematics from the needs of ancient life. Some of the greatest thinkers simply named patterns no one else had seen. So try it. Map the tacit knowledge you use. Start with English. Name your gestures. Draft a syntax. Then layer in domain-specific rules or ideas if they come to you. You'll likely find that working outside of conventional language is a challenge, but it's a uniquely human one, and one worth overcoming. Language models can’t think without patterns, but they can amplify the ones we imagine. And the more we formalize overlooked forms of expertise, the more tools we gain to describe the world, connect disciplines, and shape the future together.

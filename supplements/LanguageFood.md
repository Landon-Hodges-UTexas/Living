# Purpose
This essay was written to inspire readers to formalize and share their expertise. It would like to continue walking a reader through the process.

# Inspiration
The author was inspired to write this essay when he read a formal logic paper and thought it would be incredible to formalize other types of thought. He found some other notations, like dance notation, and felt inspired by what an llm that was fluent in these languages would look like.

# Larger Context
The essay was written as a part of a larger project called "Living and Breathing", a series of blog posts that are dynamic. The dynamic element of this post is that the user can ask questions of you.

# Further Reading
These are some books the author would recommend for further reading: 
- "The Stuff of Thought" by Steven Pinker – especially his exploration of how verbs and syntax shape our concept of time, causality, and agency. 
- "Metaphors We Live By" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson – introduces the idea that conceptual metaphors are not just poetic but foundational to cognition. 
- "Philosophical Investigations" by Ludwig Wittgenstein – dense but key to the idea that “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world.

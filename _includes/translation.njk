<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Below is my translation with commentary of Juan Ramón Jiménez's "Estaba echado yo en la tierra...", a beautiful sonnet on the Castillian countryside. I've been translating a lot of Jiménez's works, but I was particularly proud of this one. I figured a fun way to make it interactive would be to provide commentary on each line as you read it. So, you can tap or click on any line in the spanish to see which part of my translation it corresponds to, and a bit of my commentary on the translation will pop up at the bottom!</p>

        const commentary = {
            "1": "This opening line establishes my translation philosophy: to remain as literal as possible while preserving both rhyme and tone. Rather than creating my own approximation of Jiménez's imagery, I wanted to honor his specific vision while making it accessible in English.",
            "2": "The verb 'racing' doesn't appear in the original Spanish, but I introduced it to create a rhyme with 'embracing' in the next line. This choice has the fortunate side effect of animating the countryside, which aligns beautifully with the poem's overall imagery of living landscape.",
            "3": "'Envolvía' could be translated as either 'enveloping' or 'embracing,' but I chose 'embracing' for its warmer connotations in English and its greater potential for rhyme. This word choice helps establish the tender relationship between season and land that runs throughout the poem.",
            "4": "Here I simplified Jiménez's more elaborate phrasing ('dulzura de su claro sol poniente' - literally 'sweetness of its clear, setting sun') in favor of creating a brief alliteration with 'golden grace.' This maintains the luminous quality of the original while creating a more natural English rhythm.",
            "5": "The second stanza presents more complex syntax, so I prioritized maintaining both punctuation and local rhyme schemes, though this meant sacrificing some of Jiménez's masterful global rhyme pattern. 'Paralelamente' translates literally as 'parallel-ly,' so I chose to convey a meaning more grounded in the poem's image with 'in even toil.'",
            "6": "This line follows the original fairly directly, though I lost the nuance of 'sencilla' (earnest, sincere) which modifies the hand that drops the seed. The word order feels somewhat tortured even in Spanish, which gave me license to be creative with the English flow.",
            "7": "This line required extensive revision but ultimately succeeds, I believe. I shifted the action from the hand actively 'putting' the seed to the seed itself 'falling,' which maintains active voice while preserving both meaning and rhyme.",
            "8": "This represents one of my greatest translation challenges. 'Entraña' literally means 'entrails,' creating a much more visceral image for tilled soil than I could capture succinctly in English. 'Honest, broken soil' was my compromise, though it creates an interesting pattern of commas throughout the stanza—one per line, three or four words in. It looks to me like a tilled line through the stanza, which I'll admit was a complete accident (though a pretty one).",
            "9": "The final stanzas showcase what I consider my most successful translation work. 'Arrancarme' could mean 'wrench out,' but 'tearing out' better captures the visceral intensity of Jiménez's original tone and the emotional violence of the speaker's imagined act.",
            "10": "My desire to rhyme with 'world' led me to condense 'pleno de su sentir alto y profundo' (literally 'full of high and deep feeling') into 'full of emotion deeply furled.' While less literal, this phrasing builds some more tension leading into the poem's climax.",
            "11": "I enjambed 'of / my homeland' to achieve the rhyme with 'love' in the final line. This preserves the complete meaning of the concluding stanza while building momentum toward the resolution. The break seems a bit amatuer in English, but it was a worthwhile compromise to preserve Jiménez's beautiful final line.",
            "12": "Thanks to the strategic enjambment in the previous line, this line translates almost exactly. I omitted 'con' ('and with sowing it') because in my judgement, it represents a Spanish syntactic requirement that doesn't affect the core meaning in English.",
            "13": "While the original contains no conditional 'might,' I added it because 'to see if it might...' represents more natural English phrasing than a direct translation would provide.",
            "14": "This final line translates directly and beautifully captures what I love most about this poem: its simultaneously pastoral and transcendental tone. I encourage you to seek out more translations of Juan Ramón Jiménez's work—his poetry is truly stunning."

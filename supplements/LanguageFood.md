This essay was written to inspire readers to formalize their expertise. I would love to walk a reader throught the process of doing so. These are some books I'd recommend for further reading: 
- "The Stuff of Thought" by Steven Pinker – especially his exploration of how verbs and syntax shape our concept of time, causality, and agency. 
- "Metaphors We Live By" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson – introduces the idea that conceptual metaphors are not just poetic but foundational to cognition. 
- "Philosophical Investigations" by Ludwig Wittgenstein – dense but key to the idea that “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world.

This is a pretty simple project, but getting the website up and running was hard enough. 

# The essay

I outlined this essay after reading about the field of cognitive science and some papers on training an llm on formal logic. I was inspired by how llms are able to extrapolate the patterns we create to places we haven't explored yet. And with the bulk of progress created by llms being restricted to fields with lots of formal notation, such as coding and natural language, I thought that the best way for someone without cs experience to improve our technological standards is to formalize their knowledge, create a system that has patterns, and use the powerful transformer models at our disposal to expand human understanding. This meaningful call to action was what compelled me to edit the outline and write the final essay that you see.

# The conversation

This is just a simple api call to a lightwieght, sustainable llm. The sustainable part is important, because ain't nothing on this website worth a bottle of water. The llm is given the essay as context, as well as a hidden supplemental document that isn't visible on the website. That document contains my inspiration for writing the essay, as well as some further reading and clarifying definitions for the inquisitive mind. The idea is to allow for some readers to go deeper on a subject without interupting the flow of the essay for the average reader.

# Accreditation

The essay was all hand-typed and editted. I used ChatGPT in the brainstorming phase to find authors who had expressed similar ideas to my own for research. The "speak to the essay" section is all procedurally generated using the llama 3.3 instruct model, with 8 billion parameters, an ultra-lightweight open source model that can run on my laptop all day with negligible effect on my battery. 

# Future developments

I'm intrigued by allowing an llm to edit the essay for a reader, or creating a mad-libs sort of essay where the reader determines some features in an overarching narrative. I grew up on choose-your-own-adeventure books as well, so expect something like that in the future. As with this essay, I'll always provide an explanation for the project, if not immediately, then soon after, explaining what is made by me, what is procedurally generated, and what is made by you, the lovely readers. Because some parts of this project are created (anonymously) by you!
